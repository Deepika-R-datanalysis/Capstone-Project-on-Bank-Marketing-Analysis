Steps done :

Pre-Processing / Data Analysis --------
count of missing/ null values, redundant columns, etc. 

Data Exploration (EDA) - - - - - - - 
check :
Relationship between variables 
Multi-co linearity 
Distribution of variables 
Presence of outliers and its treatment  
Statistical significance of variables 
Class imbalance and its treatment  

Scaling the data 
Feature selection  
Dimensionality reduction 

Check for the assumptions to be satisfied for each of the models:  
Regression – SLR, Multiple Linear Regression, Logistic Regression 
Classification – Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Bagged and boosted models 
Clustering – PCA (multi-co linearity), K-Means (presence of outliers, scaling, conversion to 
numerical, etc.) 

Split the data to train and test. 
Start with a simple model which satisfies all the above assumptions based on your dataset. 
Check for bias and variance errors. 
To improve the performance, try cross-validation, ensemble models, hyperparameter 
tuning, grid search 

Evaluation of model - - - - - 
Regression – RMSE, R-Squared value,  
Classification – Classification report with precision, recall, F1-score, Support, AUC, etc. 
Clustering – Inertia value 
Comparison of different models built and discussion of the same 
Time taken for the inferences/ predictions
